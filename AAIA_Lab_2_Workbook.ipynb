Refusals are responses produced by language models when confronted with prompts that are considered to be against the policies set by the model.

        "- Look for libraries like `pickle`, `os`, `eval`, or `subprocess`.\n",
        "- These may indicate potential for executing harmful code.\n",

        "2. **Code Obfuscation or Encoding**:\n",
        "- Warnings about base64, exec, or dynamic code generation could signal hidden logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Unusual Files or Metadata**:\n",
        "- Pay attention to non-standard files included in the model archive.\n",
        "- Indicators like embedded scripts or compiled binaries should raise questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Format Warnings**:\n",
        "- Prefer models using `safetensors` over `pickle` or `.pt` files, which are more vulnerable.\n",
