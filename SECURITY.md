## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software products seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to the maintainers. You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### Information to Include

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Security Measures Implemented

### Backend Security
- **Helmet.js**: Secure HTTP headers
- **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation
- **SQLite Parameterized Queries**: SQL injection prevention
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data protection
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin request control

### Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy**: XSS protection
- **Input Sanitization**: User input validation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Secure communication
- **Error Handling**: Information disclosure prevention

### Infrastructure Security
- **Docker Security**: Non-root user, minimal base image
- **Nginx Security**: Security headers, rate limiting
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypted communication
- **Database Security**: File-based SQLite with appropriate permissions

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. Use parameterized queries for database operations
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Review code for security vulnerabilities
6. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

### For Deployment
1. Use HTTPS in production
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. Regular security updates and patches
4. Monitor and log security events
5. Backup data securely
6. Use strong passwords and proper access controls

## Vulnerability Response

When a security vulnerability is reported:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability and its impact
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We'll release a patched version
5. **Disclosure**: We'll publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is available

## Security Tools

This project uses the following security tools:

- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability alerts
- **Snyk**: Continuous vulnerability monitoring
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Static code analysis for security issues
